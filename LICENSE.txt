Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

--- Preamble ---
Licenses for most forms of software remove your freedoms and/or allow others to do so. Copyleft licenses were a powerful solution to prevent them from doing so, but it comes with its own problems. This license was created to prevent any form of oppression by the use of intellectual property laws beyond the very need to defend the license (i.e. we believe in the right to defend others from aggression and oppression, but we do not believe that every form of violence is aggression and oppression).

Users of this license **_must_** commit to the reality of the market and the notion of ownership over the goods that are purchased, those who buy a copy of your software are solely and exclusively responsible for all actions taken with the use of this software, in the same way, they are the rightful owners of the code and binaries they have purchased. You don't buy a pineapple by granting secondary property rights to the creators/sellers, nor should you buy software granting the right to sue, harm or threaten the integrity of any buyer to its creator/seller. In the same way that a pineapple can be used to make a juice, eat it in natura, donate, sell its parts or even throw it completely away, any purchaser/obtainer of a software should be allowed to use it at all the possible ways, freely. More than just a pineapple, software is code being contained and executed entirely on its buyer's computer, its property, it (the software) is in no way beyond "intellectually" linked to its creator/seller, but ideas publicly displayed must circulate freely, and cannot be owned by anyone. To attack or threaten anyone who buys your software in any way is to leave the intangible and touch the realm of things, it is to violate someone's legitimate property (their computer, their clothes, their own body, etc) same treatment as someone who actually assaulted another person (something you in prosecuting that person and allowing the assault against him actually did).

Proprietary licenses allow code owners to sue, threaten, and harm people who legitimately used purchased software the way they wanted; copyleft licenses allow those who do not distribute the source code or make it difficult to reverse engineer to be sued. We believe that the right to distribute its source code and allow modifications should be free, as well as the right to make it as indiscriminately difficult as possible to decompile and obtain the source code, as well as to modify it. What we are opposed to is the use of violence to secure any of these goals.

Of course, we also believe that the best form of software is free software to read the source code and modify, this practice is encouraged for all those who commit themselves wholeheartedly to the spirit of free code, but it is not something to be forced to do. There is no morality at all in doing right by being obliged, but in acting freely to do so.

The precise terms for this license follow.

--- TERMS AND CONDITIONS ---
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Any and all forms of subsequent licensing of the Software must not allow any users of the same Software to be sued, threatened, assaulted and/or have their natural rights restricted in any way by anyone involved in the production/distribution and/or sale process of the Software. Any and all reverse engineering done to the software in question must allow the free use and distribution of that same Software without any form of royalties or compensation to the developers/distributors/resellers of the Software or any third party involved therein. Purchasing a copy of the Software gives you the right to do absolutely anything with the copy of the same Software, including decompile and even distribute the decompiled code freely, as well as the Software itself as purchased. Whoever produced/distributed/sold the Software has no fault, liability or benefit warranted for any subsequent modifications made to the Software. The purchaser of a copy of the Software may also sell and/or redistribute his copy to third parties, including creating new copies of his own free will.

The terms of this license shall apply both to the content of the Software being used and to any form of merging between this Software and third party software. That is, if the source code/binaries of that Software are merged with the source code of some other software and/or used as a dependency of any kind for that software or its direct and/or indirect dependencies, the same software using it must inherit that same license for itself.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
